### 1. Install Maven

If you have trouble installing `maven` in your Ubuntu machine, you can install it in a brainless way by executing the following command at the current directory; otherwise simply skip this tip.

```bash
source ./zhifeng_helps_me.sh install_maven
```

**Remark** For `maven` installed in the above way, one can also uninstall it in an efficient manner via

```bash
source ./zhifeng_helps_me.sh uninstall_maven
```
